<p>The SSC Tuatara is a sports car designed, developed and manufactured by American automobile manufacturer SSC North America. The car is the successor to the Ultimate Aero and is the result of a design collaboration between Jason Castriota and SSC.
    Initially powered by a 6.9-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine, the capacity of the engine was later reduced to 5.9 liters in order to allow the engine to have a higher redline of 8,800 rpm.
    SSC had stated that the power output would be rated at 1,350 hp (1,007 kW; 1,369 PS) or 1,750 hp (1,305 kW; 1,774 PS) on E85 fuel, along with a 300+ mph top speed.</p>

<p>The SSC Ultimate Aero is a mid-engined sports car that was produced by SSC North America (formerly known as Shelby SuperCars) from 2004 until 2013.
    The SSC Ultimate Aero held the world production car speed record title, according to the Guinness World Records, from 2007 (when it was officially timed at 410 km/h) until the introduction of the Bugatti Veyron Super Sport in 2010.
    In April 2013, the Guinness World Records temporarily disqualified the Veyron's record time for a period of five days due to concerns about electronic speed limiting changing the function of the car, but after investigation reinstated the Veyron as the record holder.

    The SSC Ultimate Aero was not sold with electronic driver aids such as an anti-lock braking system or traction control system, as according to Jerod Shelby (no relations to Carroll Shelby), "Early design philosophy on the car was to make it a driver's car.
    I wanted a car that you not only throttled with your right foot but at times you could steer with your right foot and a sensor."</p>
