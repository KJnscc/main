<p>The Koenigsegg Jesko is a limited production mid-engine sports car produced by Swedish automobile manufacturer Koenigsegg.
    Introduced at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show, the car succeeds the Agera.
    The name Jesko is a tribute to the company founder's father, Jesko von Koenigsegg.
    The automobile is named after Jesko von Koenigsegg, the father of Christian von Koenigsegg.
    The Jesko is primarily built as a high-performance track car, with focus on high aerodynamic downforce and more precise handling.
    Koenigsegg's other current production model, the Regera, is designed as a grand touring-oriented offering.</p>

<p>The Koenigsegg Agera is a mid-engine sports car produced by Swedish car manufacturer Koenigsegg.
    It is a successor to the CCX/CCXR.
    The name comes from the Swedish verb 'agera' which means "to act" or in imperative form "(You) act!".
    It was named Hypercar of the Year in 2010 by Top Gear magazine.
    The Agera RS variant became the world's fastest production car in 2017, setting a record with a GPS-verified two-way average top speed of 447 km/h (278 mph) and a fastest straight-line speed of 458 km/h (285 mph).</p>

<p>The Koenigsegg Regera is a limited production, plug-in hybrid grand touring sports car manufactured by Swedish automotive manufacturer Koenigsegg.
    It was unveiled at the March 2015 Geneva Motor Show.
    The name Regera is a Swedish verb, meaning "to reign" or "to rule."
    Koenigsegg plans to produce only 80 units of the car, all of which have been sold.
    The Regera was developed and designed to be a more practical, luxurious, grand touring alternative to the rest of Koenigsegg's lightweight sports car lineup; initially the Agera and currently the Jesko.
    As a result, it is less focused on-track performance and spartan weight reduction and more focused on the smooth and instant delivery of power provided by its overhauled powertrain.
    Koenigsegg states that the Regera will be one of the most powerful and fastest-accelerating hybrid production cars produced.
    The introduction of the Regera alongside the Agera RS in 2015 resulted in Koenigsegg, for the first time ever, simultaneously having two models in production.
    This role was passed from the Agera to the Jesko in 2019, which has since shared the production line with the Regera.</p>
