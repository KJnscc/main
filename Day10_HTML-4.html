<p>The Bugatti La Voiture Noire is a luxury prototype supercar built by Bugatti Automobiles.
    It was unveiled at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show, in tribute to the history of the brand, and to the 110th anniversary of its founding in 1909 by Ettore Bugatti.
    Based on the Chiron, the design of the car harkens back to the Type 57 SC Atlantic and is a celebration of the company's distinctive design history.
    The La Voiture Noire is powered by the same 8.0-litre quad turbocharged W16 engine from the Chiron having the same power output figures but the 7-speed dual-clutch gearbox and the all-wheel-drive system are heavily revised in order to allow for a more relaxed driving experience.
    Softer dampers and a revised chassis contribute to the factor.
    The car has six exhaust pipes.
    Performance figures remain unknown but the company states that the car is likely to have a lower top speed and acceleration times as compared to the Chiron due to its Grand Touring nature.
    The car was sold for a price of €11 million, making it the most expensive car built to date.</p>
